      <h2>About Me</h2>

      <p>Hi, I'm Kira — a single mom of four, a student, and a fighter. I’ve faced rejection, judgment, and the uphill battle of rebuilding my life after a felony conviction five years ago. While the world continues to treat people like me as disposable, I’m working every day to prove otherwise.</p>

      <p>I’m currently pursuing my bachelor's degree in Information Technology with hopes of building a stable future for me and my children. I’ve applied to over 100 jobs and been rejected time after time, not because I’m not qualified — but because of my past. Still, I keep pushing forward.</p>

      <p>I created this space to speak up — to share my truth, my frustration, and my resilience. I know I'm not alone. There are so many others out there navigating a broken system, trying to rise above it. This blog is for us.</p>

      <p>If you've ever felt like the system was built to keep you down, I hope my story reminds you: your voice matters, your story matters, and you are not alone.</p>
